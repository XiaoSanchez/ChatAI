#ChatAI - OpenAI's ChatGPT API
ChatAI is a chat application that uses OpenAI's ChatGPT API to generate responses to user messages. It is designed to provide an engaging and conversational experience for users, while also demonstrating the capabilities of the OpenAI ChatGPT API.

##Installation
To use ChatAI, you will need to have an OpenAI API key. You can obtain an API key from the OpenAI website.

Once you have your API key, you can install ChatAI by following these steps:

Clone the ChatAI repository to your local machine
Navigate to the root directory of the repository
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following contents:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key-here>
```
Install the required dependencies by running npm install
Start the application by running npm start
Usage
To use ChatAI, simply open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the ChatAI interface, which allows you to enter messages and receive responses generated by the OpenAI ChatGPT API.

To start a conversation, simply enter a message in the input field and press the "Send" button. ChatAI will generate a response to your message and display it in the conversation window. You can continue the conversation by entering additional messages and receiving additional responses.

##Limitations
While ChatAI is designed to provide an engaging and conversational experience, it is important to note that it is not perfect and may produce responses that are inappropriate or offensive. OpenAI has implemented safeguards to prevent the generation of inappropriate content, but it is still possible for such content to be generated. Users should exercise caution when using ChatAI and report any inappropriate content to the ChatAI development team.
